## Energy Forecasting using S2S, S2S with attention, Regular RNN, and DNN models

This repository holds the general code used to complete my thesis. Note that the dataset itself has to be left as anonymous, as we worked privately with a company here in London. I have also provided my 2 papers to help better explain the code. The first is the Conference paper which explains the regular S2S model, while the second is the Journal paper which explains the S2S attention models. The conference paper was accepted to the ICIOT 2019 Conference, while we are still waiting for the outcome of the journal paper submission. If you have any questions regarding my work, feel free to email me at lsehovac@uwo.ca any time! This is a fairly short readme, and I guess I direct the formal, more complicated (sorry!) "readme" to the 2 papers.
